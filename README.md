# RuneSense

A plugin to integrate with the [Lovesense Standard API](https://developer.lovense.com/docs/standard-solutions.html)

## Usage

The plugin allows you to link to the Lovense Remote app on a device via *Game Mode* LAN.

Place the Local IP/Port found in the app into the plugin settings (**not** the plugin panel), and the plugin will use the provided information to make requests to the remote app.

The plugin panel allows configuring events and actions. An event is something that occurs in game, and an action is a request sent to the device. Different devices support different actions.
